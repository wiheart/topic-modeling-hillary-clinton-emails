Latent Dirichlet Allocation Topic Modeling on the Hillary Clinton Email Database
I got the hillary clinton email database file from kaggle.com
I'm attempting to conduct Latent Dirichlet Allocation Topic Modeling on the corpus.
I learned about this technique from doing a class project, and am interested in doing more with it.
I don't have a political opinion on this; I'm just interested in the data science aspect.
Topic Modeling is a way to quickly figure out what the common topics are in a large set of documents; and LDA is a probability statistics model.
For my class project, I used a set of documents about climate change; but I am interested in trying this on the Hillary Clinton emails.
First, I'm trying a tool called the Topic Modeling Tool (TMT) from Google Code. You can get it from here:
